> This is a project for Sparkify (a simulated start-up). 
> Sparkify wants to analyze the data they have collected on thier music straming app. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. For this project, I built an ETL pipeline using python with data modeling done in Postgres and used the query files given by them to compare my results.
